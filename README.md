# Who Am I?

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chrisdeleon
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in biking, painting, and taking on projects on my house!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently doing a deep dive on Java, learning data structures, and writing ARM assembly language. Calculus is pretty fun so far too!

## A Little About Me...

I am a full-time student at Ozarks Technical Community College and I am enrolled in the Computer Science program there. 
It was by complete chance that I came across programming and web development and, by my first introduction to it, 
I completely fell in love with the art! 

Throughout my time at OTC, I've racked up a couple of achievements which include, but are not limited to:


- [JavaScript Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/f129eadc-258d-46df-a344-eb78a5532808/public_url)

- [Databases Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/690b86da-2977-4040-a974-297e9f9664c2/public_url)

- [SkillsUSA District Champion in Web Design](https://github.com/chrisdeleon/SkillsUSARoundOne)
and in a few weeks, I'll have first place for State and Nationals ðŸ˜‰

I've also stocked up my GitHub Repository with several projects both school ones and ones that I've done in my freetime, just for fun!

## One Final Note

I'm glad you made it this far! By this point, you're probably someone from American National, the place I'll be an intern at. 
I'd be more than happy to answer any questions you might have. ðŸ™‚
