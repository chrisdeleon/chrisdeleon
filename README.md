# Who Am I?

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @chrisdeleon
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in running races (hopefully I'll do a marathon next year), kayaking, and spending time with my dogs. 
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently finishing up my software engineering project at OTC. That along with Calculus II and Physics for Engineers.

## A Little About Me...

I am a full-time student at Ozarks Technical Community College and I am enrolled in the Computer Science program there. 
It was by complete chance that I came across programming and web development and, by my first introduction to it, 
I completely fell in love with the art! 

Throughout my time at OTC, I've racked up a couple of achievements which include, but are not limited to:


- [JavaScript Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/f129eadc-258d-46df-a344-eb78a5532808/public_url)

- [Databases Certification](https://www.credly.com/badges/690b86da-2977-4040-a974-297e9f9664c2/public_url)

- [SkillsUSA District Champion in Web Design](https://github.com/chrisdeleon/SkillsUSARoundOne)

- [SkillsUSA 2nd Place Champion in Web Design](https://github.com/chrisdeleon/SkillsUSAState)

- SkillsUSA National Candidate in Video Game Design

I've also stocked up my GitHub Repository with several projects both school ones and ones that I've done in my free time, just for fun!

## One Final Note

You've made it this far! I'd be more than happy to answer any questions you might have. ðŸ™‚
